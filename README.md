# ai-debate-simulator
An AI-powered debate simulator built with [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) that stages structured debates on any topic. The system uses multiple AI agents to propose arguments, oppose them, and judge which side presents the more convincing case—all without human intervention.
